Express has a powerful routing syntax that supports dynamic routing patterns and is great for simple full stack applications. 

The problem comes in when we want to perform async controller functions. We end up either overfetching or underfetch information because of the time it takes for the promise to be completed. 

When you require controller async functionality there are better options including GraphQL, Fastify or Koa with Koa-Router or the npm package express-async-handler.
